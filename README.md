# Branchlets

A set of classes for using Autodesk Maya's C++ API to make tree branch meshes, given lists of cylindrical segments defined by a vector and radius.

Note that the master branch has an issue where when segments are facing downwards, vertex rings are not correctly aligned.

The ResizingSegVectors branch does work in all cases.
