# Branchlets

A set of classes for using Autodesk Maya's C++ API to make tree branch meshes, given lists of segments defined by a vector and radius.

This branch has an issue where when segments are facing downwards, vertex rings are not correctly aligned.  The ResizingSegVectors branch
does work in all cases.  I'm keeping this one hoping to find a solution at some point.
